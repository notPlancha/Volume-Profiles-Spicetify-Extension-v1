# This is the old version, a new one more resonsive has come out

If you're having problems, or simply want an upgrade, use [Volume Profile v2](https://github.com/notPlancha/Volume-Profiles-Spicetify-Extension-v2). The old version will still be here if you want to use is.

## Notes

* It's possible that an update to spotify or spicetify will break your saved volumes, but I've yet to experience this. If this happens, and you want a fix, update to the v2.

* This extension uses Uzair Farooq's [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive)

* It might not work on linux, I have no understanding of why tho
